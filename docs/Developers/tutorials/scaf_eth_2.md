Link to repo and instructions on how to get it up and running

So I created a scaffold repo and added the OracleReader contract. I also added the ETH/USD oracle and self-kisser addresses to the .env.example file.
If you would run a sepolia fork and deploy the contract now via yarn deploy --tags OracleReader it should work. However, I'm unable to figure out how to do a network fork...
