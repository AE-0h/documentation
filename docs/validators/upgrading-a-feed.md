# Upgrading a Validator

:::warning
Please be aware that the latest helm chart has been renamed from `feed` to `validator`. Please use the `upgrade.sh` script to upgrade your validator to the latest version. This version embeds `musig` into the `ghost` pod. The upgrader script will clean up the generated `values.yaml` file and remove the unecessary musig values.

<br/>

In order to upgrade a validator to the latest version, we will need to run a couple helm commands.

## Upgrade Helper Script

To simplify the upgrade process, we have created a helper script that will upgrade your validator to the latest version. 

This script will attempt to run `helm upgrade <feedname> -n <feedname> chronicle/validator` on your feed release, with any updated input variables.

:::caution
Please use the correct `FEED_NAME`, which should be the same as your helm release name, if deployed using the `install.sh` script previously
:::


```
ssh <SERVER_IP>
su - <FEED_USERNAME>
export FEED_NAME=my-feed
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chronicleprotocol/scripts/main/feeds/k3s-install/upgrade.sh
chmod a+x upgrade.sh
./upgrade.sh
```

:::tip You can set the expected variables in the `.env` file, or export them as environment variables. If the script fails to find any of these values, it will prompt you for them when running the script.
:::

---

## Manual process TL;DR

```
ssh <SERVER_IP>
su - <FEED_USERNAME>
export FEED_NAME=my-feed
helm repo update
helm upgrade $FEED_NAME -n $FEED_NAME -f $HOME/$FEED_NAME/generated-values.yaml chronicle/validator
```

:::caution
Please use the correct `FEED_USERNAME`, and `FEED_NAME` according to your installation
:::

### Helm Upgrade Process

First, ssh on to your server:

```
ssh <SERVER_IP>
```

Once you're on the host, make sure your you switch to the \`user\` that the feeds were installed with

Eg; assuming your user name is `feed-user` :

```
$ su - feed-user
feed-user@my_feed_host:~$ 
```


Verify that your user can view the k3s cluster resources (eg below assuming the feed is named is `my-feed`:

```
export FEED_NAME=my-feed
```

```
helm list -n $FEED_NAME
NAME     NAMESPACE    	REVISION	UPDATED                                	STATUS  	CHART     	APP VERSION
my-feed	 my-feed	10      	2023-10-12 08:22:16.725518367 +0000 UTC	deployed	feed-0.2.9	2.0.0  
```

If `kubectl/helm` commands fail, please ensure you have `$KUBECONFIG` set correctly. Take a look [here](quickstart#kubectl--helm-commands-fail) for more detail

### Prepare values.yaml

The values.yaml file is used to configure the validator. The file is generated by the install script, and should be updated to reflect the latest version of the feed chart.

With the latest version of the chart, the generated-values.yaml, there are a few changes that need to be made to the values.yaml file:

example values.yaml file:

```yaml
ghost:
  ethConfig:
    ethFrom:
      existingSecret: 'demo-eth-keys'
      key: "ethFrom"
    ethKeys:
      existingSecret: 'demo-eth-keys'
      key: "ethKeyStore"
    ethPass:
      existingSecret: 'demo-eth-keys'
      key: "ethPass"

  env:
    normal:
      CFG_LIBP2P_EXTERNAL_ADDR: '/ip4/64.46.13.31'
      CFG_WEB_URL: "myuniquetoronionaddress.onion"

  ethRpcUrl: "https://MY_L1_RPC_URL"
  rpcUrl: "https://MY_L1_RPC_URL"

tor-proxy:
  torConfig:
    existingSecret: 'demo-tor-keys'
```

:::danger
Please ensure your values yaml file is updated to reflect the latest requirements for the validator chart, with the correct values for secrets for `ethConfig` and `torConfig`, `ethRpcUrl` and `rpcUrl`.
:::

#### Notable changes include:

- `musig` is now embedded in the `ghost` deployment, and all `.Values.musig` can be remove from the values.yaml file
- `ghost.env.normal.CFG_LIBP2P_EXTERNAL_ADDR` needs to be copied from `musig.env.normal.CFG_LIBP2P_EXTERNAL_ADDR`


### Update helm repo

We need to fetch the latest helm chart from the registry:

```
helm repo update
```

### Run  helm upgrade

Now we can update to the latest version.

The latest chart version is:

using this version, we can upgrade our validator:

:::danger
Please ensure you pin the helm release to the lastest semver ChartVersion of the feed chart. eg `0.3.1`
The charts released are production ready, and tested thoroughly
:::

```
helm upgrade $FEED_NAME -n $FEED_NAME -f $FEED_NAME/generated-values.yaml chronicle/validator --version 0.3.1
```

You should see output like this:

```
Release "my-feed" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: my-feed
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Oct 12 08:21:03 2023
NAMESPACE: my-feed
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 9
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
  kubectl get pods -n my-feed
```

#### Verify the helm release and version

Verify the chart version has changed and matches what the latest feed version:

```
helm list -n $FEED_NAME
NAME     	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                                	STATUS  	CHART          	APP VERSION
validator	validator	3       	2024-04-30 18:49:58.843309576 +0000 UTC	deployed	validator-0.3.1	0.36.0   
```

#### Verify the new pods are running:

```
kubectl get pods -n $FEED_NAME
```

#### Double check the pod logs:

```
kubectl logs -n $FEED_NAME deployments/ghost
```

```
kubectl logs -n $FEED_NAME deployments/tor-proxy
```
and you're done!
