# Understanding Chronicle

### Ensure trust through verification.

Cost efficient
Verifiable 
Agnostic 
Oracle advancement 

Chronicle empowers users with advanced tooling that enables comprehensive monitoring of data transmissions, fostering a trustless environment. This paradigm shift is crucial in our onchain / offchain world.

Historically, oracle architectures predominantly employed a push mechanism for price updates. However, the trend has shifted towards a pull model in recent developments. Despite their advancements, both methodologies impose increased costs and suffer from delays in updates due to the inherent performance overheads. In contrast, Chronicle integrates Scribe, a solution that not only significantly lowers the cost associated with data updates but also accelerates the update frequency, thereby enhancing data accuracy.

At Chronicle, we are committed to optimizing your decentralized application (dApp) to ensure not only its accuracy but also to substantially reduce operational costs. Specifically, we achieve a reduction of 60% in costs on Layer 1 (L1) networks and nearly 70% on Layer 2 (L2) networks. Additionally, our approach is 80% more efficient compared to several of our major competitors, setting a new standard in the industry.
