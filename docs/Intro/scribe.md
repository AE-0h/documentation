# Scribe 

Scribe is the name for a new type of Oracle architecture developed by the team at Chronicle Labs. The design is built around 5 pillars:

- <b>S</b>calability
- <b>T</b>ransparency
- <b>A</b>ccessibility
- <b>R</b>esilience
- <b>S</b>ecurity


Scribe v1 achieves significant progress towards each pillar; however, there are more features planned that will further enhance Scribe’s STARS.


Scribe is an extremely gas-efficient Oracle based on aggregated Schnorr signatures. Providing nearly constant gas costs on Layer 2s and on Layer 1s, Scribe boasts of fixed gas costs, leading to substantial savings—over <b>60%</b> relative to competing Oracles and an impressive <b>80%</b> compared to Chainlink. This approach to gas management significantly boosts the scalability of the Oracle.

The Chronicle Scribe Oracle interface is plug-and-play with Chainlink and Maker Oracles, providing a smooth transition for developers used to these platforms.

All data delivered by a Chronicle Oracle on mainnet is verifiable via The Chronicle Dashboard.
